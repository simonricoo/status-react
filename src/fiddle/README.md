# Fiddle Status Components
All components in Fiddle should be independent of the app state. They should be pure,
and easy to reason about. This is required to make the library independent and
easily pulled off as a separate repository when needed.
Do avoid high coupling and direct use of internal styling, the components should be
exported via namespace `fiddle.core` and used by status app only from here. This will
allow a more flexible way to update components without possible breakages into the
app style.

Fiddle components should and not have any dependency on the status app, this
will avoid circular dependency and also benefit the independence of the components.

All components are stored inside `components` namespaces. They are stateless and do
not dispatch and subscribe to re-frame database. All state should be passed by props
and all events can be passed as functions. Avoiding direct connection with re-frame
will allow components to grow and be reused in different places without the
conditionals hell.

All style system constants are stored inside `design-system` namespaces. They are used
to build components and can be directly required by the status app. Avoid
duplication of these vars and do not use them in code directly as a value.

For each component introduced, add previews of all possible states.

Do not introduce components for slightly modified existing components, if they are
not a part of the design system. In case they are required in one place in the app,
use style override.

# Code style
Ensure that your changes match the style of the rest of the code.
This library uses Clojure Community code style [The Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide)
To ensure consistency run [clj-kondo linter](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo)

# Best practices

- Desing components atomically and compose them into bigger components.
- Do not export individual atoms, only components. This way we can limit design
system to be used in too many way which can creating disjointed experiences.
- Avoid external margins for atom components, it can be added on the wrapper
where they are used but can't be removed without overriding.

- Explicit is better than implicit, do not rely on platform default, if you expect
a specific value, then override it
